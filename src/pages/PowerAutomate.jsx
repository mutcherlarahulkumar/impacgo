      question: "What is Microsoft Power Automate and what can it automate?",
      answer:
        "Microsoft Power Automate is a workflow automation platform that lets you build automated processes across Microsoft and third-party systems without traditional coding. It can automate approval workflows (purchase orders, leave requests, expense claims), data synchronisation (D365FO to SharePoint, Excel to Teams), document processing (invoice extraction with AI Builder), scheduled tasks (daily reports, alerts), and desktop RPA (legacy system data entry automation). It connects to 500+ Microsoft and third-party systems via pre-built connectors.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does a Power Automate project take?",
      answer:
        "A single Power Automate flow typically takes 1-3 weeks to design, build, test, and deploy. A complete automation project covering multiple business processes (e.g., 4-6 flows for procurement automation) takes 4-6 weeks. Complex flows involving custom connectors, AI Builder, or desktop RPA can take 6-8 weeks. Impacgo follows an agile sprint model with weekly demos.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can Power Automate replace our existing approval workflows in email?",
      answer:
        "Yes — and this is one of the most common Power Automate use cases for Indian enterprises. We replace email-based approval chains (where POs and expense claims get stuck in inboxes) with structured approval flows in Power Automate. Approvers receive notifications in Teams, Outlook, or mobile, approve with one click, and the system automatically routes to the next approver or pushes the data into D365FO. Full audit trail included.",
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between Power Automate cloud flows and desktop flows (RPA)?",
      answer:
        "Cloud flows run in Microsoft's cloud and connect modern API-enabled systems (D365FO, SharePoint, Salesforce, etc.) — fast, scalable, and the default choice for modern automation. Desktop flows (Power Automate Desktop) run on a Windows machine and automate legacy applications that don't have APIs — by simulating clicks, keystrokes, and screen reading. This is true RPA (Robotic Process Automation) and is typically used to bridge gaps between modern Microsoft systems and older non-API legacy systems.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does Power Automate require licensing fees?",
      answer:
        "Microsoft Power Automate has per-user and per-flow licensing options. Some basic flows are included with Microsoft 365 subscriptions you may already have. Premium connectors (like SAP, Oracle, Salesforce) and AI Builder capabilities require Power Automate premium licensing. Impacgo helps you understand the licensing strategy that fits your specific use case — and we optimise flow design to minimise license costs where possible.",
