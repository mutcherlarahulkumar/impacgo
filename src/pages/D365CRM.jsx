      question: "What is Dynamics 365 CRM and which modules does it include?",
      answer:
        "Dynamics 365 CRM (Customer Engagement) is Microsoft's customer relationship management platform. It includes Dynamics 365 Sales (lead-to-opportunity-to-order pipeline management), Dynamics 365 Customer Service (case management, SLAs, omnichannel support), Dynamics 365 Marketing (customer journeys, email marketing, segmentation, event management), and Dynamics 365 Field Service (technician scheduling, work order management, IoT-driven service). Each module is licensed separately and can be deployed independently or together.",
    },
    {
      question: "Should we use Dynamics 365 CRM or Salesforce?",
      answer:
        "Both are leading CRM platforms. The right choice depends on your existing systems and team familiarity. If you're already on Microsoft 365, Teams, SharePoint, or D365 Finance & Operations, Dynamics 365 CRM offers significantly tighter integration, better Office and Outlook embedding, and a lower total cost of ownership. If your team is Salesforce-native or you have heavy AppExchange dependencies, Salesforce may be better. For Indian companies running Microsoft Dynamics F&O, D365 CRM is almost always the right answer — the integration with D365 F&O is native and seamless, giving you one unified customer view from lead to invoice.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does a D365 CRM implementation take in India?",
      answer:
        "A single-module D365 CRM implementation (e.g., just Sales or just Customer Service) typically takes 8-14 weeks. A multi-module implementation covering Sales + Customer Service + Marketing takes 4-6 months. Heavily customised CRM with multiple integrations, complex business rules, and migration from legacy systems takes 6-9 months. Impacgo follows an agile delivery model with sprint-based releases — your sales or service team starts using new functionality every 2-4 weeks rather than waiting for big-bang go-live.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does D365 CRM integrate with D365 Finance & Operations?",
      answer:
        "Yes, natively. Microsoft provides a Common Data Service / Dataverse integration layer that synchronises customers, products, sales orders, invoices, and payments between D365 CRM and D365 F&O. Sales reps in CRM see real-time stock and pricing from F&O. Finance team in F&O sees the full sales pipeline and customer history from CRM. This is one of the biggest reasons to choose Microsoft over Salesforce when you're running Dynamics F&O — you get a unified customer record without expensive third-party middleware.",
    },
    {
      question: "What does a D365 CRM implementation cost in India?",
      answer:
        "Costs vary based on modules, user count, customisation level, integration scope, and data migration complexity. Microsoft D365 CRM licensing (Sales Professional, Sales Enterprise, Customer Service Enterprise, Marketing, Field Service) is per-user-per-month and separate from implementation services. Indian enterprises typically budget separately for licensing and implementation. Impacgo offers a free D365 CRM consultation that delivers a detailed scope, licensing recommendation, realistic timeline, and budget proposal specific to your sales and service operations.",
