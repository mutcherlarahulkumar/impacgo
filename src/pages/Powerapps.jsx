      question: "What is Microsoft Power Apps and how is it different from custom app development?",
      answer:
        "Microsoft Power Apps is a low-code platform for building custom business applications without writing extensive code. It lets you create both canvas apps (for mobile and tablet-first scenarios) and model-driven apps (for data-heavy business processes). Compared to traditional custom development, Power Apps delivers apps 3-5x faster, integrates seamlessly with Dynamics 365 and Microsoft 365, and is significantly cheaper to maintain over time — making it ideal for extending D365FO with mobile interfaces, automating internal processes, and digitising paper-based workflows.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to build a Power App?",
      answer:
        "A typical Power App takes 4 to 8 weeks from kickoff to go-live. A simple departmental app (timesheets, approvals, basic inspections) can be delivered in 4 weeks. A complex Power App connected to Dynamics 365 F&O with offline support, role-based security, and custom workflows typically takes 6-8 weeks. Impacgo follows an agile delivery model with weekly demos so you see progress every sprint.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can Power Apps connect to our existing systems like D365FO, SAP, or legacy databases?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Power Apps comes with 500+ pre-built connectors including Microsoft Dynamics 365 F&O, Dynamics 365 CRM, SharePoint, Teams, SQL Server, Oracle, SAP (via OData/REST), Salesforce, and many more. For systems without a standard connector, we build custom connectors using REST APIs. This means your Power App can read and write data to any business system you currently use.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do Power Apps work offline for field workers and shop floor staff?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Canvas Power Apps support offline data capture — perfect for shop floor production reporting, field service inspections, warehouse stocktakes, or remote site visits where connectivity is intermittent. Data syncs automatically when the device comes back online. Impacgo designs offline-first architecture so your field team never loses data due to network issues.",
    },
    {
      question: "What does Power Apps development cost in India?",
      answer:
        "Power Apps development costs vary based on app complexity, number of screens, integrations required, and security requirements. A simple departmental app typically costs significantly less than a custom-developed mobile app. Microsoft Power Apps licensing (per user or per app) is separate. Contact Impacgo for a free consultation and detailed proposal based on your specific use case.",
