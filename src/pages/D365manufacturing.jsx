      question: "Which Dynamics 365 module is best for Indian manufacturers?",
      answer:
        "For most Indian manufacturers, the right product is Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations (D365 F&O) — formerly known as Dynamics AX. It includes Production Control, BOM and Routings, Master Planning (MRP/MPS), Quality Management, Warehouse Management, and full Indian compliance (GST, TDS, e-invoicing). It supports discrete manufacturing, process manufacturing (food, chemicals, pharma), and lean manufacturing models. Dynamics 365 Business Central is an option for smaller manufacturers (under 50 users), but most Indian mid-size and enterprise manufacturers will outgrow it within 2-3 years.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does a D365 manufacturing implementation take in India?",
      answer:
        "A typical D365 F&O manufacturing implementation for a single Indian plant takes 6-9 months from kickoff to go-live. Multi-plant rollouts (3-5 plants) take 9-15 months with a hub-and-spoke deployment model. Heavily customised process manufacturing implementations (formula-based food or chemical with batch tracking, expiration management, and quality regulations) can take 12-18 months. Impacgo follows a phased approach with parallel-run before go-live to minimise plant disruption.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can D365 F&O integrate with our existing MES and shop floor systems?",
      answer:
        "Yes. D365 F&O integrates with most MES platforms (Wonderware, Rockwell, Siemens MES, custom MES) using REST APIs, OData, or middleware like Azure Logic Apps. The most common pattern is bidirectional sync — D365FO sends work orders, BOMs, and routings to the MES; the MES sends back actual production, scrap, downtime, and quality data. This closed-loop integration gives planners and supervisors a single source of truth on production status. Impacgo also builds Power Apps for shop floor operators when the existing MES is being phased out or extended.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does D365 F&O support GST, TDS, and Indian statutory reporting for manufacturers?",
      answer:
        "Yes. D365 F&O has the India localisation pack which includes GST (input, output, IGST, SGST, CGST), TDS, TCS, e-invoicing with IRP integration, e-way bill generation, GSTR-1, GSTR-3B, GSTR-2A reconciliation, and statutory reporting for the Companies Act. For manufacturers specifically, Indian excise (where applicable), job work tracking, and subcontracting workflows are also supported. Impacgo configures these for your specific operations and trains your finance team for month-end and statutory cycles.",
    },
    {
      question: "What does a D365 manufacturing implementation cost in India?",
      answer:
        "Costs vary based on number of plants, transaction volume, level of customisation, integrations required (MES, third-party systems, e-commerce), and chosen partner. Microsoft D365 F&O licensing is separate from implementation services and is based on user count and capacity. Impacgo offers a free Manufacturing Discovery Workshop that delivers a detailed scope, recommended deployment approach, realistic timeline, and budget estimate specific to your manufacturing operations.",
