      question: "When does Microsoft AX 2012 support end?",
      answer:
        "Microsoft ended mainstream support for Dynamics AX 2012 R3 in October 2021. Extended support ends in January 2028. After January 2028, Microsoft will no longer provide security patches, regulatory updates (including GST and TDS rule changes for Indian businesses), or hotfixes for AX 2012 — making it a compliance and security risk to continue running.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "How long does an AX 2012 to D365 Finance and Operations migration take?",
      answer:
        "A straightforward AX 2012 migration with minimal customisations typically takes 9 to 12 months. A heavily customised AX 2012 environment with multiple integrated systems and 10+ years of transaction data can take 18 to 24 months. The migration assessment alone takes 4-8 weeks. Starting your migration project in 2026 leaves comfortable runway before the January 2028 deadline; starting in 2027 does not.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "What are the three approaches to migrating AX 2012 to D365FO?",
      answer:
        "There are three migration approaches: (1) Code Upgrade — upgrades existing AX customisations to D365FO extensions; fastest path but preserves existing customisation debt. (2) Reimplementation — treats the D365FO project as a fresh implementation using lessons learned from AX; most future-proof but requires significant business change management. (3) Hybrid — upgrades the core AX code while redesigning heavily customised areas from scratch; the most common approach for Indian enterprises with mixed levels of AX customisation.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "What does an AX 2012 to D365FO migration cost for Indian enterprises?",
      answer:
        "Migration costs vary based on the volume of AX customisations accumulated over the years, complexity of historical transaction data, number of integrated systems, and chosen migration approach (code upgrade, reimplementation, or hybrid). Impacgo offers a free 4-8 week migration readiness assessment that delivers a detailed cost estimate, recommended approach, and project timeline specific to your AX 2012 environment.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "Why should we start AX migration planning now if go-live is two years away?",
      answer:
        "The full migration cycle takes longer than most companies expect: migration assessment (4-8 weeks) + partner procurement and contracting (2-4 months) + actual migration project (9-24 months). Starting in 2026 gives you runway to complete migration before January 2028 with time for stabilisation, regression testing, and user adoption. Starting in 2027 forces a rushed migration with no buffer for unexpected issues — a serious risk for enterprises running critical financial and operational processes on AX 2012.",
