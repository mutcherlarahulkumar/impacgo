      question: "What is Dynamics 365 Commerce and how is it different from D365 F&O?",
      answer:
        "Dynamics 365 Commerce is Microsoft's specialised retail platform built on top of D365 Finance & Operations. It adds retail-specific capabilities: cloud POS, modern POS for in-store, e-commerce storefronts, customer-facing shopping apps, loyalty programmes, store inventory management, omnichannel order fulfilment, and dynamic pricing. D365 Commerce shares the same backend as D365 F&O — so inventory, financials, procurement, and sales orders are unified across stores, online, and warehouses. Indian retailers running multi-store operations almost always need D365 Commerce, not just D365 F&O.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does a D365 Commerce implementation take for an Indian retailer?",
      answer:
        "A single-region retailer with 5-20 stores typically implements D365 Commerce in 6-9 months. Multi-region retailers with 50+ stores and complex omnichannel scenarios (in-store, online, mobile, marketplace) typically need 9-15 months. Fashion and food retailers with seasonal pricing, promotions, and rapid product lifecycle management often need 12-18 months. Impacgo follows a phased approach — go-live with a pilot store cluster first, then roll out to remaining stores in waves.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does D365 Commerce support Indian GST and e-invoicing for retailers?",
      answer:
        "Yes. D365 Commerce has the India localisation pack covering: GST calculation at POS (correct CGST/SGST/IGST split), e-invoicing with IRP integration for B2B sales above threshold, e-way bill generation for inter-state stock transfers, retail-specific GST treatment (composition scheme, retail invoice formats), TCS handling, and GSTR-1/3B reporting. Receipts, invoices, and bills auto-format with Indian compliance requirements. We've configured this for several Indian retail clients — both single-state and multi-state operations.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can D365 Commerce integrate with our existing e-commerce platform like Shopify or Magento?",
      answer:
        "Yes. While Microsoft offers its own D365 Commerce e-commerce storefront, you can also integrate D365 F&O/Commerce with Shopify, Magento, WooCommerce, custom React platforms, or marketplaces (Amazon, Flipkart) via REST APIs and middleware. The integration covers product catalog sync, real-time inventory, order import, customer sync, and price/promotion updates. Impacgo builds these integrations using Azure Logic Apps, Azure Functions, or custom middleware depending on volume and complexity.",
    },
    {
      question: "What does a D365 Commerce implementation cost in India?",
      answer:
        "Costs vary based on number of stores, modules deployed (POS only vs full omnichannel), customisation, integration scope (e-commerce, payment gateways, logistics partners), and chosen partner. Microsoft licensing for D365 Commerce includes per-device POS licensing plus user licensing for back-office and is separate from implementation. Impacgo offers a free Retail Discovery Workshop with detailed scoping, deployment approach recommendation, realistic timeline, and budget specific to your retail operations.",
