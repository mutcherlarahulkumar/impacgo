      question: "What is X++ and why do D365FO customisations need it?",
      answer:
        "X++ is the proprietary programming language used by Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations (and its predecessor, Dynamics AX). All D365FO customisations — custom forms, business logic, batch jobs, integrations, security rules — are written in X++. While Microsoft offers many no-code/low-code options through Power Platform, deep ERP customisations still require X++ expertise. Impacgo's developers are X++ specialists with years of D365FO and legacy AX experience.",
    },
    {
      question: "What's the difference between extensions and over-layering in D365FO?",
      answer:
        "Over-layering was the customisation model in legacy Dynamics AX where developers modified Microsoft's source code directly. This created upgrade nightmares — every Microsoft update could break custom code. In D365FO, Microsoft enforces an extension-first model: you extend or augment Microsoft's code via hooks and event handlers without modifying it. The result is upgrade-safe customisation. Impacgo builds all D365FO development using extensions, never over-layering — your code survives every D365FO platform update.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do you support Azure DevOps and CI/CD for D365FO?",
      answer:
        "Yes. We set up full ALM (Application Lifecycle Management) for D365FO using Azure DevOps. This includes source control with Git, automated build pipelines, release pipelines for deployment to Tier-2/Tier-3 environments, automated testing, and LCS (Lifecycle Services) integration. Multi-developer teams can work in parallel safely. Code reviews and pull requests are mandatory. No more emailing XPP files between developers.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can you integrate D365FO with our other business systems?",
      answer:
        "Yes. We build D365FO integrations using OData entities, custom services (SOAP/REST), data import/export framework (DIXF), Azure Service Bus, Azure Logic Apps, and direct database APIs where appropriate. Common integrations include CRM systems, e-commerce platforms (Shopify, Magento), banking and payment gateways, logistics partners, MES, IoT, and custom legacy applications. We follow integration patterns that are reliable, monitorable, and recoverable.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you charge for D365FO development work?",
      answer:
        "We offer two engagement models: (1) Fixed-price for well-defined scope projects (e.g., a specific custom report, a defined integration). (2) Time and materials with a dedicated D365FO developer or developer pod for ongoing development needs. Most clients with continuous customisation needs prefer the dedicated developer model — predictable monthly cost, full team integration, no scope negotiation overhead.
