      question: "When exactly does AX 2012 support end?",
      answer:
        "Microsoft ended mainstream support for Dynamics AX 2012 R3 in October 2021. Extended support — the final phase of Microsoft's support lifecycle — ends in January 2028. After that date, no more security patches, no more regulatory updates (including GST or TDS rule changes), and no more hotfixes.",
    },
    {
      question: "What happens to AX 2012 after January 2028?",
      answer:
        "After January 2028, AX 2012 will continue to run technically, but Microsoft will no longer provide security patches, regulatory updates, or hotfixes. Newly discovered security vulnerabilities will remain unpatched permanently. For Indian enterprises, this also means GST rule changes, TDS rate changes, and any future compliance requirements will not be reflected in the system — requiring manual workarounds that auditors and compliance teams typically cannot accept.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does AX 2012 to D365FO migration take?",
      answer:
        "A straightforward AX 2012 migration with minimal customisations typically takes 9 to 12 months. A heavily customised AX 2012 environment with multiple integrated systems and 10+ years of transaction data can take 18 to 24 months. The migration assessment alone takes 4-8 weeks.",
    },
    {
      question: "Should we migrate via code upgrade, reimplementation, or hybrid approach?",
      answer:
        "The right approach depends on your level of AX customisation. Code Upgrade is fastest but preserves existing customisation debt — best if your AX 2012 has minimal, well-documented customisation. Reimplementation is most future-proof but requires the most business change management — best if your AX implementation is heavily customised or poorly documented. Hybrid is the most common approach — upgrades core AX code while redesigning heavily customised areas from scratch.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "When should we start the AX 2012 to D365FO migration project?",
      answer:
        "Start the migration readiness assessment in 2026 at the latest. The full cycle takes longer than most companies expect: assessment (4-8 weeks) + partner procurement (2-4 months) + migration project (9-24 months). Starting in 2026 gives you runway to complete before the January 2028 deadline with time for stabilisation. Starting in 2027 forces a rushed migration with no buffer for unexpected issues.",

              1. What actually happens when extended support ends in January 2028
            </h2>

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Extended support is the final phase of Microsoft's product
              lifecycle. After January 2028, three specific things change for
              every AX 2012 user — and each of these creates a measurable
              business risk for Indian enterprises:
            </p>

                <span>
                  <strong>No security patches.</strong> Every newly discovered
                  vulnerability in AX 2012 will remain unpatched permanently —
                  creating an ever-expanding attack surface for the system that
                  holds your financial, customer, and operational data.
                </span>
              </li>
              <li className="flex items-start">
                <CheckCircle className="h-5 w-5 text-red-500 mr-3 mt-0.5 flex-shrink-0" />
                <span>
                  <strong>No regulatory updates.</strong> GST rule changes, TDS
                  rate changes, e-invoicing updates, and any future Indian tax
                  or compliance requirements will not be reflected in AX 2012.
                  Your finance team will be forced into manual workarounds — and
                  auditors typically will not accept those workarounds
                  indefinitely.
                </span>

                <span>
                  <strong>No hotfixes.</strong> Known bugs that affect financial
                  close, inventory accuracy, or production scheduling will not
                  be resolved — your team works around system issues rather than
                  through them.
                </span>

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-8">
              This is not a vendor sales pitch. This is a compliance and
              security risk management issue that your finance team, auditors,
              and board will need to formally assess. For most Indian
              enterprises with mandatory statutory reporting and security audit
              requirements, the answer is the same: migrate before January 2028.

              2. Why AX 2012 to D365FO migrations take longer than companies expect
            </h2>

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
              The most common mistake Indian enterprises make when planning the
              AX 2012 migration is underestimating the timeline. Three factors
              consistently extend AX migrations beyond initial estimates:

              </h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Most AX 2012 environments have been running for a decade or
                more. Over that time, customisations have accumulated — many
                undocumented, some written by developers who have long since
                left the company. Every customisation has to be inventoried,
                assessed, and either upgraded to D365FO extensions or rebuilt
                from scratch. This single phase often takes 3-6 months on its
                own.

              </h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                Indian enterprises carry years of transaction data with specific
                tax implications — GST adjustments, TDS deductions, statutory
                reports, e-invoicing references. Migrating this data is not a
                simple export-import exercise. Every record needs to be
                validated against current tax rules, reconciled with previously
                filed returns, and verified to ensure audit continuity. Data
                migration alone typically takes 3-4 months for established
                enterprises.

              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                D365 Finance and Operations handles certain processes

                costing, procurement workflows, warehouse management, and
                financial dimension structures. Business processes that were
                designed around AX 2012 capabilities need to be redesigned
                rather than just lifted and shifted. This requires functional
                workshops with each department, decisions on which D365FO
                features to adopt, and a change management programme.

              The bottom line

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              If you are running Indian operations on AX 2012, the migration to
              D365 Finance and Operations is not a project to defer to 2027.
              The deadline is real, the migration timeline is longer than most
              boards assume, and the consequences of running unsupported ERP
              after January 2028 — for security, compliance, and audit — are
              not consequences Indian enterprises can afford.
            </p>

            <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-12">
              The right action in 2026 is to commission a migration readiness
              assessment. It takes 4-8 weeks, it is typically free, and it
              gives your board a concrete plan with timeline and budget. From
              there, you have the information needed to make the migration
              decision — and the runway to execute it before the January 2028
              deadline.
