      question: "What is Microsoft AI Builder and what does it do?",
      answer:
        "Microsoft AI Builder is the low-code AI engine built into the Power Platform. It lets you add prediction, document processing, text classification, sentiment analysis, and object detection capabilities directly inside Power Apps screens and Power Automate flows — without writing machine learning code. It ships with pre-built models for invoices, receipts, business cards, and IDs, and lets you train custom models for your domain using your own data. Think of it as 'AI for the Power Platform' — accessible to citizen developers and IT teams, not just data scientists.",
    },
    {
      question: "What's the most common AI Builder use case for Indian enterprises?",
      answer:
        "Invoice and purchase order data extraction. Indian enterprises receive thousands of supplier invoices each month as PDFs or scanned documents. AI Builder's pre-built invoice processing model extracts vendor name, invoice number, line items, GST amounts, totals, and dates — and Power Automate pushes the structured data into D365FO with validation rules and approval routing. This single use case typically saves 30-60% of accounts payable team time and dramatically reduces invoice processing errors.",
    },
    {
      question: "Do we need a data science team to use AI Builder?",
      answer:
        "No. That's the entire point of AI Builder. The pre-built models (invoice processing, receipt processing, business card reader, ID reader, sentiment analysis, key phrase extraction, language detection) work out of the box with zero training. For custom prediction models (e.g., predicting customer churn or sales lead quality), AI Builder walks IT teams and business analysts through a wizard — pick your data table, pick the column to predict, click train. The platform handles model selection, validation, and deployment. Impacgo helps with the domain-specific configuration and integration into your business processes.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does AI Builder integrate with Dynamics 365 F&O?",
      answer:
        "AI Builder integrates with D365FO through Power Automate flows and Power Apps. Typical pattern: a PDF invoice arrives in SharePoint or email → Power Automate flow triggers → AI Builder extracts the invoice data → Power Automate validates against vendor master in D365FO → if valid, creates a pending invoice in D365FO accounts payable → routes for approval. The same pattern applies to PO acknowledgments, delivery notes, expense receipts, and customer order forms.",
    },
    {
      question: "What does AI Builder cost in India?",
      answer:
        "AI Builder uses credit-based licensing. Each AI Builder action (invoice extracted, prediction made, etc.) consumes a small number of credits. Credits are purchased in capacity packs (1 million credits per pack). Most Indian enterprises start with one capacity pack and scale up based on actual usage. Impacgo helps you estimate credit consumption based on your specific use case during the consultation — and we optimise flow design to minimise unnecessary AI calls.",
