      question: "Which Dynamics 365 module is best for Indian distributors and wholesalers?",
      answer:
        "For most Indian distributors, wholesalers, and trading companies, the right product is Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations (D365 F&O). It includes Advanced Warehouse Management (WMS), Trade Agreements (customer and vendor pricing structures), Multi-Location Inventory, Sales Order Management, Procurement, and full Indian compliance (GST, TDS, e-invoicing, e-way bills). It scales from single-warehouse traders to multi-state distributors with 20+ locations. Dynamics 365 Business Central works for smaller distributors (under 50 users, 1-2 locations), but most growing Indian distributors will outgrow it.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does a D365 distribution implementation take in India?",
      answer:
        "A single-entity, single-warehouse D365 F&O distribution implementation typically takes 5-7 months from kickoff to go-live. A multi-state, multi-warehouse rollout with advanced WMS, trade agreements, and e-commerce integration takes 9-12 months. Importer-distributors with import documentation, customs duty handling, and bonded warehouse requirements typically need 9-15 months. Impacgo follows a phased approach with parallel-run before go-live so your daily operations stay live throughout.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can D365 F&O handle multi-warehouse and multi-state inventory for Indian distributors?",
      answer:
        "Yes. D365 F&O Advanced Warehouse Management handles unlimited warehouses, sites, and locations. Indian distributors typically configure separate warehouses for each branch or godown, with stock transfer orders for inter-warehouse movement. The system handles GST-compliant branch transfers (with e-way bills auto-generated), stock-in-transit accounting, and consolidated reporting across all locations. Real-time inventory visibility — sales teams see exactly what's available in every warehouse before promising customers.",
    },
    {
      question: "Does D365 F&O integrate with our B2B customer portal and e-commerce?",
      answer:
        "Yes. D365 F&O integrates with B2B customer portals (built on Power Apps Portals, custom React/Angular apps, or third-party platforms) using REST APIs. Common integrations include: customer self-service order placement, real-time stock and pricing display, order tracking, invoice download, and payment integration. For B2C e-commerce, D365 F&O integrates with Shopify, Magento, WooCommerce, and custom platforms via APIs. Impacgo builds these integrations using Azure Logic Apps, custom middleware, or direct API calls — whichever fits your scale.",
    },
    {
      question: "What does a D365 distribution implementation cost in India?",
      answer:
        "Implementation costs vary based on number of warehouses, transaction volume, level of customisation, integrations required (B2B portal, e-commerce, transport management, logistics partners), and chosen partner. Microsoft D365 F&O licensing is separate and is based on user count. Impacgo offers a free Distribution Discovery Workshop that delivers a detailed scope, recommended deployment approach, realistic timeline, and budget specific to your distribution operations.",
